//! Controller logic for the Zical API.
//!
//! Each module under `api` represents a different root level mount-point for endpoints, such as
//! [`teams`][teams] for `/teams`. Every module's mount-point is described by its `MOUNT_POINT`
//! value, and its list of routes by `routes()`.
//!
//! [teams]: ./teams/index.html

/// Ignite a [`Rocket`][rocket], attach endpoints and return it.

/// [rocket]: ../../rocket/struct.Rocket.html
pub fn ignite() -> Rocket {
    rocket::ignite()
        .mount(self::MOUNT_POINT, self::routes())
        .mount(teams::MOUNT_POINT, teams::routes())
